Hero vs Enemy – Python Game (Pygame)

A 2D arcade-style shooting game built using Python and Pygame. This project was developed during my Game Development Mentorship internship and used to teach programming concepts to middle and high school students.

Overview

Hero vs Enemy is a simple real-time game that demonstrates:

Game state management (Menu, Playing, Game Over)

Event-driven programming

Collision detection

Timer-based enemy respawning

Score and high score tracking

Life system with visual indicators

Sound integration using Pygame mixer

Technologies Used

Python

Pygame

Object-based game architecture

Event handling and animation loops

Key Features

Multiple enemies with independent state tracking

Explosion animations with delay logic

Persistent high score tracking during session

Button-driven UI interaction

Frame rate control using clock ticks

Educational Impact

This project was originally created to reinforce core computer science concepts such as:

Loops and conditional logic

State machines

Event handling

Modular problem solving

The project was also translated into Java to practice generics and recursion concepts introduced in CS 2013 (Data Structures).

Running the Game

Install pygame:

pip install pygame


Run:

python hero_vs_enemy.py
