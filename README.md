Hero vs Enemy Game
Python | MIT App Inventor | Game Development Mentorship

Developed a 2D arcade-style shooting game using Python (Pygame) to reinforce concepts I mentored in block coding with MIT App Inventor

Originally created and taught this game to middle and high school students during my internship with Tecnolochicas Fundacion Televisa

Integrated features like game states, UI buttons, sound effects, lives system, score tracking, and enemy collision

Applied CS 2013 concepts including recursion and generics by translating the project into Java for further practice

This project represents one of my most meaningful and longest-running mentorship builds
