# Hero vs Enemy – Python Arcade Game (Pygame)

A 2D arcade-style shooting game built using Python and Pygame.  
Originally developed during my Game Development Mentorship internship and used to teach programming concepts to middle and high school students.

## Project Overview

Hero vs Enemy is a real-time arcade game that demonstrates:

- Game state management (MENU, PLAYING, GAME_OVER)
- Event-driven programming
- Collision detection
- Timer-based enemy respawning
- Score and high score tracking
- Life system with visual indicators
- Sound integration using Pygame mixer
- Frame rate control using a structured game loop

This project reinforces structured problem-solving and interactive system design.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame
- Object-based game architecture
- Event handling and animation loops
- State machine logic

---

## Key Features

- Multiple enemies with independent state tracking
- Explosion animations with delay timers
- Persistent session high score tracking
- Button-driven UI interaction
- Real-time input handling
- Structured main game loop

---

## Educational Purpose

This project was created to reinforce core computer science concepts, including:

- Loops and conditional logic
- State machines
- Event handling
- Modular problem solving
- Object interactions

The project was later translated into Java to practice generics and recursion introduced in Data Structures coursework.
